==BO#TERI ~Can you control it? Like a third hand?~
~...I can yes.~
==BO#TERI ~Ohh that sounds practical! Just think of all the pranks you could pull off it that, how many purses you could steal, the locks you could pick when nobody is looking...~
==AWCassB ~...and the doors I can get it caught in. The holes I have to sow into my armor and clothes to accomodate it. Having to pay special attention in battle so that it doesn't get cut off...~

==BO#SEVER ~Alas, my muse strikes me when and where she pleases. And it wouldn't do for me to leave out any important details from our travels.~
==AWCassB ~I mean... surely there are some parts which are less important that you could leave out. I don't think anyone wants to read three conscecutive chapters of: 'They got up in the morning. They marched all day, They struck up camp and went to bed.'~
==BO#SEVER ~Aha but you forget that it's those chapters that make the whole ordeal more relatable. And of course they also provide excellent opportunities for the audience to get up and go for snacks!~

==BO#NELLA ~Perhaps. But I worry that not everyone would afford the same respect to the Great Oak as we do.~
==AWCassB~Nonsense! It is a great source of warmth and life amidst the cold of the north. What reason would the Ten Towns possibly have to harm it?~
==AWCassB~Certainly it would be an adjustment for some. But think of the benefits that a strong wall could provide for it's security! And with proper roads you could have a hundred knights stationed for it's protection in case of another threat arising.~

==BO#NELLA ~Thank you, Cassia. Did you feel the same way when the other Watchknights left you behind in Easthaven?~
==AWCassB~Perhaps a little. The feelings of abandonment were certainly there, but I knew I still had the eyes of the Vigilant One watching over me. The situation you were placed in was far more hopeless and yet you continue to push through it. I admire that you had that kind of strength.~

==BO#SEVER IF ~IsGabber("O#SEVERN") !StateCheck("O#SEVERN",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Hey, I'm above making things up aside from a few embellishments of course...~
==AWCassB ~Well, Mirabar was built upon the foundations of a dwarven stronghold which has influenced it's design and architecture greatly. And while I'm certain it cannot compete with the crown jewel of elven culture, I was wondering how a city planned with elvish architecture would compare.~
==BO#KORIN ~It is unlike anything I have seen since coming to the north. When humans and dwarves build their cities, they see it as an act of conquering the wilds and building atop it. But my people's architects make every effort to preserve the existing beauty of the world and to enhance it with our own. Splendid manors are melded seamlessly into the hills and cliffs which surround the main city and the blueleaf trees which dot the valley are sung into shapes of pure artistry.~
==BO#KORIN ~The heart of the city is built upon a marble pedestal which rises above the verdant planes below and white spires stretch towards the sky, imitating the mountains which guard it's outskirts from all sides.~
==AWCassB ~When I heard tales of the city at first, I was skeptical if such a place could truly exist. But hearing it described in your own words I can see now that those descriptions are but fumbling attempts to describe it's grandeur. How I wish I could see it with my own eyes one day!~
==BO#KORIN ~That might prove difficult, especially if you do not receive an invitation from the Elders. Many travelers and adventurers arrive at the Halfway Inn outside the city petitioning for entry only to be turned away.~
==AWCassB ~Perhaps. It is something I can dream about at least.~ EXIT
