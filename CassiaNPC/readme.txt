==> CASSIA NPC FOR IWD:EE
==> Mod by Arvendor
==> Version 1.01 Beta

INTRODUCTION:

This mod adds a new joinable companion to the IWD:EE - the tiefling Cassia. Cassia is a young cleric of Helm who originally hails from Mirabar and has journeyed to Easthaven at the behest of her church to render what aid she can to Hrothgar's expedition. As a devout helmite, she will do everything in her power to protect the Ten Towns and to root out the evils which threaten them. But will she find herself equal to the task or will she break beneath the responsibility?

Cassia is a single-classed cleric with the Helm kit and may be recruited outside the Temple of Tempus in Easthaven. She has a small quest associated with her which will naturally conclude over the course of the game and may be romanced by male dwarves, humans, elves, half-elves and half-orcs with a charisma score of 10 or higher. She will react and interject to both the main game and the expansion. As of writing this she does not have any banters with other NPC mods for Icewind Dale. She tends to get along better with good aligned characters but she will not object to following the lead of an evil player so long as they don't cross the moral event horizon.

INSTALLATION:

As any other Infinity Engine mod - unpack the mod in game's main directory and run WeiDU installer (Setup-CassiaNPC.exe). Then, follow instruction that will be displayed in WeiDU window.

As an optional sub-component, you are given the option to modify the existing healing spells in Icewind Dale so that they can affect tieflings. In certain versions of the game the Tiefling race is immune to healing spells and thus cannot be healed by them. This component deletes the effect in question from the spells which grant this immunity. This component does not touch any of the 'harming' spells. My recommendation is to quickly check if you can heal Cassia without installing this component (she starts with 1 cure light wounds memorized for this purpose.). If the spell fails to affect her, install this component.

The list of the modified spells are as follows:

Cure Light Wounds 		- sppr103.spl
Cure Moderate Wounds	- sppr217.spl
Cure Medium Wounds		- sppr315.spl
Cure Serious Wounds		- sppr401.spl
Lesser Restoration		- sppr417.spl
Cure Critical Wounds	- sppr502.spl
Mass Cure Light Wounds	- sppr514.spl
Heal					- sppr607.spl
Regeneration			- sppr711.spl
Greater Restoration		- sppr713.spl
